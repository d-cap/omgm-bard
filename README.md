## Planned features

- Manage:
  - NPCs;
  - locations;
  - objects;
  - notes;
  - world history;
  - world info;
  - game sessions;
  - PCs;
  - quests;
  - future ideas;
- Save the entire campaign in single file;
- Export settings specific to you campaign so you could reuse them;
- Search inside all the data you inserted to allow to find what you really need;
- Include cross references between data so you could know in which session you use a specific NPC;
- ... and more.

The first version will be available soon with the search and NPC management.
